# zero-shot-configuration-file-validation
Develop a validator that checks whether a given configuration file meets specific criteria. The configuration file is considered “zero-short” if it is either empty (zero-length) or contains only a minimal amount of data (short length). The validator must ensure that the configuration file adheres to a predefined structure and format.
